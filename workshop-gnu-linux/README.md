# GNU/Linux Workshop
**Executive Summary:** This document contains the materials for the UVA residential MSDS workshop on GNU/Linux. It is a compainion to the initial orientation given prior to the start of study. This workshop is part of a series designed to help students with the world larger than their own laptop. A world of high-performance computing and of cloud computing, a world dominated by GNU/Linux.

## Outline
* Introduction and Preamble
1. GNU/Linux minimum for Data Scientists
2. How to GNU/Linux

## Introduction
1. `whois` lpa2a
2. What is GNU/Linux
    * Unix = an operating system, not necessarially under open license
    * GNU = "GNU's not Unix", software suite in need of a kernel under GPL [6]

3. Why GNU/Linux? Simply put: it is the only relevant operating system

    * One exception: Playing video games, which is >95% windows
4. Goals for today
    * first half = exposure to fundamentals
    * second half = equip you to build the habit
5. GNU/Linux is a habit
    * exposure
    * practice

# Footnotes
[1]  TOP500 list. The benchmark we decided on was Linpack, which means that systems are ranked only by their ability to solve a set of linear equations, A x = b, using a dense random matrix A. Therefore, any supercomputer – no matter what its architecture is – can make it into the TOP500 list - topp500.org
