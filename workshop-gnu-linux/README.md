# Footnotes
[1]  TOP500 list. The benchmark we decided on was Linpack, which means that systems are ranked only by their ability to solve a set of linear equations, A x = b, using a dense random matrix A. Therefore, any supercomputer – no matter what its architecture is – can make it into the TOP500 list - topp500.org
