# Unix 101
**Executive Summary:** This Document is the lesson plan for unix. We will teach using 'Bash' (Bourne Again Shell). We will explore how to get access to a Bash terminal regardless of operating system. And then the first commands a user commonly encounters.

## Main takeaway: ????

**NB**: MacOS is off the Unix family tree

## Getting Started BASH
Now that you have the background, it is time to get your machine set up with BASH. The first step is the software. Here are instructions depending on your platform:

* Mac: Open a terminal. (Use the spotlight search to find the app named “terminal.”) (NB: depending on the age of your computer you may be running a different but similar shell)
* Linux: Open a terminal. (You will need to look it up because it depends on your flavor.)
* Windows: Unfortunately, BASH is not necessarily native on a Windows machine. Install VSCode (see item 3 on checklist). Open a terminal (Ctrl+Shift+`) 

## First Commands

## Editing a File

## Running 'hello world'

## The PATH forward
