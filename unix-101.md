# Unix 101
**Executive Summary:** This Document is the lesson plan for unix. We will teach using 'Bash' (Bourne Again Shell). We will explore how to get access to a Bash terminal regardless of operating system. And then the first commands a user commonly encounters.

## Main takeaway: Github is a social media platform
Put yourself on high-alert and remember all of the pitfals of social media lurk just under the surface on github.

**NB**: MacOS is off the Unix family tree

## Getting Started BASH
Now that you have the background, it is time to get your machine set up with BASH. The first step is the software. Here are instructions depending on your platform:

* Mac: Open a terminal. (Use the spotlight search to find the app named “terminal.”) (NB: depending on the age of your computer you may be running a different but similar shell)
* Linux: Open a terminal. (You will need to look it up because it depends on your flavor.)
* Windows: Unfortunately, BASH is not necessarily native on a Windows machine. Install VSCode (see item 3 on checklist). Open a terminal (Ctrl+Shift+`)

### What questions can we learn from this data? (category 1)
### What questions can we not answer from this data? (category 2)
### What additional data can we gather to move questions from category 2 to category 1?
### What additional data can we gather to make our answers to category 1 questions more accurate?
### How can you use this presentation of your personal data to your advantage?

# Conclusions, Homework, and Takeaways
* **NB:** Github is constantly improving the website, sometimes things move
* Get used to looking at people's github profiles, but don't get sucked into traps (it is just more social media)
* Like facebook and other social media: people's profiles can cause: discouragement, discomfort,  intimidation. This is a challenge and is complex. Keep your sheilds up and head on a swivel. Have a friend to talk to and I am always available.
* Explain to a curious person how github is really just social media.
