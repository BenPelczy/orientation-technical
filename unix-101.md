# Unix 101
**Executive Summary:** This Document is the lesson plan for unix. We will teach using 'Bash' (Bourne Again Shell). We will explore how to get access to a Bash terminal regardless of operating system. And then the first commands a user commonly encounters.

## Main takeaway: ????

**NB**: MacOS is off the Unix family tree

## Getting Started BASH
Now that you have the background, it is time to get your machine set up with BASH. The first step is the software. Here are instructions depending on your platform:

* Mac: Open a terminal. (Use the spotlight search to find the app named “terminal.”) (NB: depending on the age of your computer you may be running a different but similar shell)
* Linux: Open a terminal. (You will need to look it up because it depends on your flavor.)
* Windows: Unfortunately, BASH is not necessarily native on a Windows machine. Install VSCode (see item 3 on checklist). Open a terminal (Ctrl+Shift+`) 

## First Commands
Bash is a CLI. To do anything you must input a command and often some additional parameters. The challenge is how to learn those commands in the first place. Here is the workflow to start with.

1. type a command
2. press the enter key
3. read the output the computer prints back to you

Let's dig in ....

### pwd
This command stands for 'print working directory'. A working directory is the location in the operating systems file structure where commands will operate from. By analogy if you asked someone where they are they may say something like "1600 Pennsylvania Ave". In that way when you say to the computer 'pwd' it will say it's location.

### ls
The next thing you may want to know is what files are in the working directory. The 'ls' command stands for 'list'. By analogy if you asked someone what do you see in front of you they may say "The White House". In that way when you say to the computer 'ls' it will list 'what it sees' at that location.
