# Unix 101
**Executive Summary:** This Document is the lesson plan for the github profiles. We will explore the github profile. Talk about the main features and how to use it. And finish with an exercise in data science thinking.

## Main takeaway: Github is a social media platform
Put yourself on high-alert and remember all of the pitfals of social media lurk just under the surface on github.

## Definitions
1. Unix
2. Linux

## Let's breakdown a github profile
* Black Box - contact info
* Blue Box - Repositories you choose to highlight (aka 'pin')
* Red Box - WARNING!!! Will Disscuss later!!!

## Here is a collage of some more profiles

# Exercise - Data Science Thinking Time

* Look at this github profile - https://github.com/alonzi - I will be our guinea pig

## Now focus on the commit graphic

## Now take a swing at these questions
### What questions can we learn from this data? (category 1)
### What questions can we not answer from this data? (category 2)
### What additional data can we gather to move questions from category 2 to category 1?
### What additional data can we gather to make our answers to category 1 questions more accurate?
### How can you use this presentation of your personal data to your advantage?

# Conclusions, Homework, and Takeaways
* **NB:** Github is constantly improving the website, sometimes things move
* Get used to looking at people's github profiles, but don't get sucked into traps (it is just more social media)
* Like facebook and other social media: people's profiles can cause: discouragement, discomfort,  intimidation. This is a challenge and is complex. Keep your sheilds up and head on a swivel. Have a friend to talk to and I am always available.
* Explain to a curious person how github is really just social media.
