# VS Code

Visual Studio Code or VS Code is a powerful tool for getting data science work done. In your career you will have many choices about which tool to use, but for now, trust us, we will start with VS Code for teaching the core skills. As you develop you can explore other tools and decide what you like the most.
Why VS Code? Well as of 2022 according to Stack Overflow VS Code is the most popular coding environment with about three quarters of the market share!

In this badge we will get VS Code up and running and you will work through the fundamentals of **getting a coding environment up and running on your laptop**. This is an **essential skill for every data scientist** to develop, but, beware, it is not easy. This requires good mental preparation and fortitude. Expect to stumble and get frustrated.


## Requirements

1. **read** about:
   1. the difference between: text editors, word processors, and integrated development environments.
   2. the specific history and differences between Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code (n.b. we will use VS Code)
   3. Shells, focus on the difference between a Graphical user interface (GUI) and a Command line interface (CLI)
   4. the specific history of Bash (Bourne Again Shell), its syntax, and environment variables (especially PATH)
   5. package management and specifically the package manager conda and "conda environments"

   * Tell a friend about what you learned and how they can use the tools in their everyday life even if they are not a programmer. Explain to them why people would configure their environmetn before programming. Explain the difference between: text editors, word processors, and integrated development environments.

2. **install** VS Code and use the *Source Control* panel to clone a GitHub repository.
   * If you're like me and prefer not to use the mouse, Ctrl+Shift+G is the shortcut key to open the panel.
   * You may need to install git during this process. Go for it! You can do it!

3. **configure** the default terminal in VS Code to be "Git Bash"
   * If you're like me and prefer not to use the mouse, Ctrl+Shift+P and then enter "Terminal: Select Default Profile"
   * This can be a very tricky step. Sometimes VS Code will have trouble finding something you installed and you have to do extra work to find it. But rest assured, this will be effort well spent, because issues such as this arise **CONSTANTLY** in Data Science work.

4. **connect** VS Code to GitHub.
   * Work on your cloned repo, commit a change, and push that change back up to GitHub.
   * In this process you may have to configure your profile with a terminal command like 
    
        `$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"`
   
        `$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`
   * In this process you may also have to sign into GitHub from VS Code to give permission to modify the repo on GitHub.








2. **decide** for yourself if GitHub is version control software or social media. Discuss your answer with another member of your cohort. (Find several sources about the uses of GitHub and understand those use cases.)

3. **goto** a github repository and click on everything. everything!

3. **create** a github account. Remember that this account will present you to the professional world. Seek out and read three sources about how you can use your GitHub profile in a job interview setting. 
 
4. **create** a GitHub repository. This repository will contain materials you gather and learn during this orientation. It will:
     1. Have a README.md file - This file is the welcome page to your repository and serves to orient new arrivals. Find three sources about how to use the README effectively on a GitHub repository. Find three sources about how to use the markdown format effectively. Take what you like and craft your README. You can always edit it later so focus more on form than content.
     2. Have a LICENSE - Read about common licenses used on GitHub. Read the UVA School of Data Science reccomendation on Open Science. Explore why licensing your work is important and explain that significant to another member of the cohort.
     3. Use the browser based editor to modify your files
     4. Share your repository

5. **fork** a repo. make an edit. issue a pull request. Choose from one of these repos:
    1.  https://github.com/alonzi/star_wars_power_rankings
    2.  https://github.com/alonzi/projectEuler

    * For help understanding Collaborative Coding use the resources here: https://github.com/features

5. **read** [Code Review Guidelines for Humans](https://phauer.com/2018/code-review-guidelines/)
    * Commit to ...
      * being humble.
      * asking if someone wants to recieve feedback before giving feedback (Sometimes, people just need you to listen to them).
    * Select one principle from this article and share it with a member of your cohort. Tell them why it resonated with you and what you will do to keep it in your mind.
    * Explore literature about the interaction of human emotions and programming especially when critique is involved. Incorporate these ideas into your conversation with your friend.

7. **read** about higher order features of GitHub. Pick ONE from each category. https://github.com/features
    * go to https://github.com/features and select ONE from
       * Automation and CI/CD
       * Security
    * and ONE from
       * Project Management
       * Team Administration
    * for each be able to summarize what you learned to a friend who knows about GitHub but hasn't explored these features themselves and is curious about them.
 
8. **analyze** three different GitHub repsitories along the axis of documentation. Decide for yourself which repositories have better and worse documentation and what moves you would like to incorporate in your work going forward.

9. **seek** out the GitHub page for THREE faculty members you are interested in meeting. Read the page and develop several questions about the contents the spark your curiousity.

10. **seek** out the GitHub page for THREE alumni of the School of Data Science. Investigate one of their projects and prepare a list of questions you would ask them if the opportunity presents itself.

11. **investigate** the data behind an article you are reading. For an article that you have read that contains a data visualization follow the trail back to where the data came from and how they generated their visualizations. If you find a GitHub page explore it. If not repeat this requirement.
