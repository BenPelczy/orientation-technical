# Python

Python is a tool well suited to Data Science work. We will treat it as such. Python is not the goal of this badge. The goal is to accomplish tasks like solving mathematical problems, data visualization, and data analysis **using** python. In meeting these requirements you will build a proficiency in python, but that is not sufficient. You must continue to use the skill over time to build and maintain the habit.

Prerequisites: GitHub, VS Code

## Requirements

** draft thoughts, hasn't been polised for presentation yet, take with grain of salt*

reading about python packages
reading about python history


1. prepare your environment
    2. configure a new conda environment with any version of python3 you like
    3. confirm the right python extension is running in vs code
    4. create a github repo for your work and link it to vs code
    5. install these packages: matplotlib, numpy, pandas

2. solve problems 1,2,3 from project euler

3. use a random number generator to make histograms of popular probability distributions. choose THREE from the list below
    * Binomial
    * Poisson
    * Normal
    * Uniform
    * Chi Squared

4. Visually Demonstrate that Binomial and Poisson distributions approximate the normal distribution in a limiting case by creating histograms.

5. load the data from the class hardware survey into memory using pandas, manipulate that data into a binnable form, and make exploratory histographs of the features of the dataset.

6. For the features you couldn't address with a histogram provide a qualitative description.
