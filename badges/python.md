# Python

Python is a tool well suited to Data Science work. We will treat it as such. Python is not the goal of this badge. The goal is to accomplish tasks like solving mathematical problems, data visualization, and data analysis **using** python. In meeting these requirements you will build a proficiency in python, but that is not sufficient. You must continue to use the skill over time to build and maintain the habit.

Prerequisites: GitHub, VS Code

## Requirements

** draft thoughts, hasn't been polised for presentation yet, take with grain of salt*

1. **read** about:
    * python history
    * python design philosophy and features
    * python indentation
    * python packages
    * VS Code extensions
    * Random Number Generators
    * Histograms
    * Data Frames


1. prepare your environment
    2. configure a new conda environment with any version of python3 you like
    3. confirm the right python extension is running in vs code
    4. create a github repo for your work and link it to vs code
    5. install these packages: matplotlib, numpy, pandas

2. solve problems 1,2,3 from project euler. store your solution code in your github repo

3. use a random number generator to make histograms of popular probability distributions. use the numpy and matplotlib packages. choose THREE from the list below and store your resulting code in your github repo.
    * Binomial
    * Poisson
    * Normal
    * Uniform
    * Chi Squared

4. Visually Demonstrate that Binomial and Poisson distributions approximate the normal distribution in a limiting case by creating histograms. Store the resulting histograms in your github repo. Make a mini presentation using a markdown file in your github repo explaining the proof.

5. load the data from the class hardware survey into memory using pandas, manipulate that data into a binnable form, and make exploratory histographs of the features of the dataset. Store your data in your github repo.

6. For the features you couldn't address with a histogram provide a qualitative description. Present these findings with your histogram findings via a markdown file in your github repo. Share your mini presentation with another member of your cohort.
