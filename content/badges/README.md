# BADGES README
This readme shows the tech tree for UVADS technical orientation badges. Each node represents a badge. The requirements for the badges are found in the markdown files.

There are two kinds of badges: skills badges and program badges. For example a student working on their MSDS badge may engage with several of the skills badges.
