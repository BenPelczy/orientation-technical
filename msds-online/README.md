# Welcome to the Online MSDS Technical Orientation
Hello there. Welcome to the technical orientation for the online MSDS program. This orientation is conducted through our learning management system UVACollab. Here is the link for the collab site: [link](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/50e991d8-e0cf-427e-9c68-e70334d46ff6)

## What to expect
This material is designed for someone to get up to a certain level of readiness across various Data Science technical areas. It consists of 5 modules and the time to complete the modules varies based on your prior experience in those areas. A good benchmark is to plan 2 hours per module for a total of 10 hours of preparation time.

The content is asyncronous and includes student:student and student:professor interaction via the message board system inside of collab. For any and all questions please post to the message boards first so that all students can see the question. The best case scenario is that another student can help with your question which helps to build a tighter student connection. I will be monitoring the boards and jump in as appropriate. (If there are matters of a personal/private nature please email the professor).
