# Cloud Workshop

## Warp Up
Look up and record these metrics for your laptop
* CPU Cycle Rate (in GHz)
* CPU Number of Cores (int)
* RAM (in GB)
* Hard Drive Size (in GB)
* GPU

## Welcome
1. Introduction
2. Preamble
3. The Data Scientist Minimum for Cloud
4. Your first HPC project

## Introduction
1. `whois` lpa2a
2. goals for today
    * Define and Motivate Cloud
    * Part I: Present the Data Scientist Minimum
    * Part II: Make individual plans for building HPC proficiency
    * Secret goal: But really, I just want you to ask questions

## Preamble

### "There are real computers on the ground"

## A quick note
We are going to talk about cloud computing but we will talk in the AWS vernacular.

## Exercise 3 - Do a price comparison

## Why use the cloud
1. Scale
2. Prototyping
3. Reproducibility

## A few nuts and bolts
* s3
* ec2
* iam
* lambda

### Event-driven computing

# Break

## Your first prototype
1. Create an event stream
2. Catch those events via an API
3. Store those events in s3
4. Perform analytics with lambda
5. Share results
