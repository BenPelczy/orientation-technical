# Github Profiles 101
**Executive Summary:** This Document is the lesson plan for the most important system configuration diagnostic tool. We will explore the program 'hello world'.

## Main takeaway: If you can run 'hello world' your system is set up.

## Reminder of Definitions
1. 'hello world' - a type of program, characterized by minimum overhead to demonstrate a system is set up and functional
2. system - for example a programming environment. for example python

## "hello world" .... what is it good for?
Wikipedia puts it extremely well
> A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code.[1][2] It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.

* In this orientation we are going to be setting up resources and the goal is to finish with the ability to run 'hello world'.
* The second thing that it does is provide a beachhead. When you encounter a new computer environment by running 'hello world' a person has established the base upon which to build their foundation.

# Conclusions, Homework, and Takeaways
* **NB:** Github is constantly improving the website, sometimes things move
* Get used to looking at people's github profiles, but don't get sucked into traps (it is just more social media)
* Like facebook and other social media: people's profiles can cause: discouragement, discomfort,  intimidation. This is a challenge and is complex. Keep your sheilds up and head on a swivel. Have a friend to talk to and I am always available.
* Explain to a curious person how github is really just social media.
