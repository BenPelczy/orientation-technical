# Github Profiles 101
**Executive Summary:** This Document is the lesson plan for the most important system configuration diagnostic tool. We will explore the program 'hello world'.

## Main takeaway: Github is a social media platform
Put yourself on high-alert and remember all of the pitfals of social media lurk just under the surface on github.

## Reminder of Definitions
1. Git is a version control software program
2. GitHub is a subsidiar of Microsoft and therefore is a for profit company
3. github.com is a website and serves as the front end for all GUI services

## Let's look at a github profile

## Let's breakdown a github profile
* Black Box - contact info

# Exercise - Data Science Thinking Time

* Look at this github profile - https://github.com/alonzi - I will be our guinea pig

## Now focus on the commit graphic

## Now take a swing at these questions
### What questions can we learn from this data? (category 1)
### What questions can we not answer from this data? (category 2)
### What additional data can we gather to move questions from category 2 to category 1?
### What additional data can we gather to make our answers to category 1 questions more accurate?
### How can you use this presentation of your personal data to your advantage?

# Conclusions, Homework, and Takeaways
* **NB:** Github is constantly improving the website, sometimes things move
* Get used to looking at people's github profiles, but don't get sucked into traps (it is just more social media)
* Like facebook and other social media: people's profiles can cause: discouragement, discomfort,  intimidation. This is a challenge and is complex. Keep your sheilds up and head on a swivel. Have a friend to talk to and I am always available.
* Explain to a curious person how github is really just social media.
