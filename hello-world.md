# Conclusions, Homework, and Takeaways
* **NB:** Github is constantly improving the website, sometimes things move
* Get used to looking at people's github profiles, but don't get sucked into traps (it is just more social media)
* Like facebook and other social media: people's profiles can cause: discouragement, discomfort,  intimidation. This is a challenge and is complex. Keep your sheilds up and head on a swivel. Have a friend to talk to and I am always available.
* Explain to a curious person how github is really just social media.
