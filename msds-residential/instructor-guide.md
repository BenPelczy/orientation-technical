  * Task: 
    * your computer is your main too
    * being a human using computers
    * science ethics
    * mindful of our relationships outside of school
    * bulk of the time hard technical skills
  * Criteria
  * My role is to coach

* Triad time #2 (20min) -- Let's talk about humans
  * From a new traid
  * Play 3?s
  * do #2 from checklist (read blog and complete the steps after it)

    * welcome to grad school
    * let's talk about how to know when you've done something, grad school style
    * also about how to know if you found a good source or not, i don't tell you the sources you have to seek them out and learn how to discern if they are quality
    * Some of you may have mastered parts of this orientation, here's your mission ...

* Triad time #4 (20min)
  * Form a new triad
  * Play 3?s

* There is 80 min of triad time which leaves 40 min of instructor time. you have to read the room, more triad time is probably better especially for #4 (badges)
