## The Checklist

0. **watch** Jurassic Park ([link to free access via uva library](https://digitalcampus-swankmp-net.proxy1.library.virginia.edu/uva296909/play/bafece83e07de665?referrer=marc))

    * Explain two ethical challenges the characters in the movie face and what you would do in their place.
    * Discuss with a member of your cohort: strategies for identifying ethical challenges in the digital world.

1. **complete** computer hardware survey - [link](https://forms.gle/RL3JY8m4RRjWesRL8)

2. **read** [Code Review Guidelines for Humans](https://phauer.com/2018/code-review-guidelines/)

    * Commit to ...
      * being humble.
      * asking if someone wants to recieve feedback before giving feedback (Sometimes, people just need you to listen to them).
    * Select one principle from this article and share it with a member of your cohort. Tell them why it resonated with you and what you will do to keep it in your mind.

3. **call** someone you should call more often and tell them about what you are excited to learn this summer

4. **complete** the following 3 badges:

    * GitHub - [link](https://github.com/UVADS/orientation-technical/blob/main/badges/github.md) - ![](https://github.com/UVADS/orientation-technical/blob/main/content/images/github-badge.png)
    * VSCode - [link](https://github.com/UVADS/orientation-technical/blob/main/badges/vscode.md) - ![](https://github.com/UVADS/orientation-technical/blob/main/content/images/vscode-badge.png)
    * Python - [link](https://github.com/UVADS/orientation-technical/blob/main/badges/python.md) - ![](https://github.com/UVADS/orientation-technical/blob/main/content/images/python-badge.png)

You may work on these badges in any order and simultaneously. If you would prefer to go sequentially starting from first principles the reccomended order is: GitHub --> VSCode --> Python.

## For when you want to kick back and watch some content
* This playlist will help you to get to know Professor Alonzi and computer hardware better. It is a little dated, but still relevant. This falls sqarely in what we call systems. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1ZfpZ3HSwI&list=PLc0No4e8MMEPztUFVdtazgWi7L7pWakfO&index=1))
* This playlist provides perspectives on fundamental Data Science principles from what we call Design, Value, and Analytics. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm5xF-UYgdg&list=PLc0No4e8MMEPagWbHNrEIXx6nuWg7xFdq))
* The UVA Data Science YouTube Channel also has great videos! ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0t9SVI4We4))
